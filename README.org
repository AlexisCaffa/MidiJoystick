** MidiJoystick


 MidiJoystick is a JackClient which lets you use your joystick as a midicontroller.
 You can map all axes and buttons to diffrent midi commands and channels.
 Main usage would be as using it as Continuous Controller (CMD: 0xB0)
 and Pitch Bend (CMD: 0xE0).

 Use 'jstest' to workout the input indices of your joystick.

 On start 'midijoystick' will list your current configuration. Or you can use
 'explain_config' to check your configuration.


 Currently joystick device file and configuration is hardcoded as:

 | file          | path           |
 |---------------+----------------|
 | joystick      | /dev/input/js0 |
 | configuration | ./input.conf   |

Additional Notes
----------------

 The joystick api maps axes values to a int16_t (positive and negative) range. While midi data bytes range from 0x00 to 0x7F.
 So we're mapping the axis values to uint16_t and then to the midi data range (0x00 - 0x7F), thus a axis value of 0x00 is a midi
 value of 0x40. An axis value of 0x00 occures when the axis controler is at center position.

 Buttons emit midi values of 0x7F when pressed and 0x00 when released, so their usefullness is subpar as for example
 mapping a button to Note-on would make not much sense.
